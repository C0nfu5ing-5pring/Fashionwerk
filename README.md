# Fashionwerk

Fashionwerk is a CSS practice project inspired by the **[Erikk Template](https://erikk-template.webflow.io/)** on Webflow. The goal of this project is to experiment with modern CSS techniques and improve my front-end styling skills.

## ðŸŽ¨ What I Practiced
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox** â€“ For creating responsive and structured layouts.
- **Typography & Spacing** â€“ Experimenting with fonts and white space for a clean design.
- **Dark & Minimalist Theme** â€“ Inspired by high-end fashion websites.
- **Media Queries** â€“ Ensuring the design looks great on all screen sizes.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `index.html` â€“ Main HTML structure.
- `style.css` â€“ Custom styling for the project.
- `assets/` â€“ Images, icons, and other resources.

## ðŸ“Œ Inspiration
This project is inspired by the **Erikk Template** from Webflow. It is purely for **educational purposes** and personal skill development.
